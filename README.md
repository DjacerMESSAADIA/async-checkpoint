# Async Operations Checkpoint

## Overview

The project includes five main tasks that showcase different aspects of asynchronous programming:

1. **Parallel Iteration**
   - Demonstrates how to iterate over an array asynchronously
   - Uses Promise.all for parallel execution
   - Includes controlled delays between operations

2. **API Call Simulation**
   - Simulates API calls with timeout handling
   - Implements comprehensive error handling
   - Provides user-friendly error messages

3. **Chained Async Operations**
   - Shows how to execute multiple async operations in sequence
   - Demonstrates proper async function chaining
   - Uses delays to simulate real-world scenarios

4. **Concurrent Requests**
   - Handles multiple simultaneous API requests
   - Implements timeout for concurrent operations
   - Manages multiple promises with Promise.race and Promise.all

5. **Parallel API Calls**
   - Fetches data from multiple URLs concurrently
   - Includes retry mechanism for failed requests
   - Implements batch processing to prevent network overload
   - Features timeout handling and abort controller

## Features

- Arrow functions
- Async/await implementation
- Promise handling
- Error boundaries
- Timeout mechanism
- Retry logic
- Batch processing
- AbortController implementation

## Usage

```javascript
// Run all examples
node async_operations.js
```

## Configuration Options

The parallel calls function accepts several configuration options:

```javascript
await parallelCalls(urls, {
    timeout: 3000,  // Maximum time per request (ms)
    retries: 2,     // Number of retry attempts
    batchSize: 2    // Number of concurrent requests
});
```

## Error Handling

The code implements comprehensive error handling including:
- Request timeouts
- Network failures
- Invalid responses
- Retry mechanisms
- User-friendly error messages

## Best Practices Demonstrated

- Proper Promise handling
- Efficient parallel processing
- Resource management
- Error boundary implementation
- Code modularity
- Modern JavaScript conventions
